# checkerboard

Using python & flask I was able to recreate a checkerboard starting with 8x8 rows and columns. Manipulating the routes, we are able to change the size and color of the board. For example, http://127.0.0.1:5000/10/10 would bring back a 16x16 board, and http://127.0.0.1:5000/10/10/purple/green would bring back a 16x16 board with green and purple tiles.
